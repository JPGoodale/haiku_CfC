Haiku implementation of Closed-form Continuous-time Neural Networks as presented in: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13898. 
Designed to be used as a simple Haiku module like any other (hk.Linear, hk.LSTM etc), and therefore does not include any datasets or training loop. An example notebook using the IMDB dataset will be added soon.
