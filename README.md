# Closed-form Continuous-time Neural Networks in Haiku
Haiku implementation of Closed-form Continuous-time Neural Networks (CfCs) as presented in: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13898. 
Designed to be used as a simple standalone Haiku module, dataset and training loop taken directly from https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku/tree/main/examples/rnn for comparison with LSTM.
